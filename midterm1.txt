#1) Given a product of random variables what does the CLT tell us about such a system?

#2) Random walk in 1D by unit steps.  With the probability to go right of $p$ and a probability to go left of $1 -p$ what are the first two moments of the final position of the particle.

#3) state and prove Liouville's theorem

4) given distribution of gas molecules in a box with velocities $v_i$, what's the effect of a collision in words of a pair of molecules with velocities $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$.  After a long time what will these velocities.  Is this system Ergotic.

5) Given a 1 dimensional phase space for a SHO, where the particle energy lies in the region $E - \Delta$ and $E + \Delta$, what's the volume of the phase space shell.
